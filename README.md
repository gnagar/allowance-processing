## Changes

    1. Added skeleton of the project. Text files were added because GitHub doesn't let you add blank folders into your repositories.
    2. Dependencies for `Spring Boot`, `Spring Boot web`, `BootStrap`, and `Spring Boot Mail` were added.
    3. Adding `JPA` resulted in errors for some reason. Jackson and JPA are included in the `Spring Boot Starter` dependency.
